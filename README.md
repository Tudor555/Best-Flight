# Best-Flight
Find the best flight using Google Flights
The project consists of an automation built with UiPath that finds the best flights using user-supplied data. Using Google Flights, it searches for flights and then, with the help of artificial intelligence, automatically composes and sends an email in response, providing the user with the information sought in an efficient and fast way.
